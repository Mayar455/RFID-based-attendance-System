# RFID-based-attendance-System
Today, attendance at schools and colleges is paper-based. Sometimes this process exploits and takes more time. This project uses RFID technology to take notes for every student who enters a class, and also calculates the time spent in a class.
In this system, each student is given an RFID tag. Participation can be done by placing the card next to the RFID reader.
